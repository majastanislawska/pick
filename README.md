Welcome to the Pick (&#x1D745;&#x1D450;&#x1D458;) project!

Pick (&#x1D745;&#x1D450;&#x1D458;) is a spinoff of [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/) that focuses on Pick and Place machines.

That is:
 * support for extra axes (working M114)
 * USB Power Delivery (CH224Q configurable over i2c) for a slim toolhead board
 * central endstop (todo)
 * support for pumps, valves, and pressuure sensors, not just by reusing feaures related to hotend/hotbed temperature (todo)
 * feeders control (servo for now)

more to come.
